                    <p>A real estate discovery site, written in React.</p>
                    <p>The front-end employed React's Context + Hooks for state management. Almost all class-based components were factored out. The CSS was largely BEM-ified.</p>
                    <p>The backend: Django/DRF, AWS, S3, Docker, Gitlab</p>

                    <p>Working within Scotts’ challenging CMS, I “re-skinned” both desktop and mobile versions of the site. Due to internal template and architecture limitations, the markup and includes are not as clean or optimized as I would like. The effort, however, resulted in a dramatic improvement over the previous site.</p>

                <p>While the site has since been redesigned, I was responsible for moving the front-end code from PHP-generated static HTML to dynamic Tiles/JSTL pages which were served from Akamai using ESI. I also overhauled the Facebook login integration and profile section.</p>
